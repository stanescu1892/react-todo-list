To-Do List App with Firebase Authentication, React Context, and React Bootstrap
This is a to-do list app built with React, React Bootstrap, Firebase Authentication, and Sass. It provides users with a convenient and secure way to manage their tasks, with the added benefit of being able to log in with their Google account through Firebase Authentication.

In addition to these technologies, the app also utilizes React Context to manage state and pass data between components. This makes it easier to keep track of the current user and their to-do list, and ensures that the data is always up-to-date and consistent.

Getting Started
To launch the app, simply clone the repository and run npm start in your terminal. This will start the app on your local server, and you can then view it in your web browser.

Features
One of the key features of this app is the ability to change the status of each task. Tasks can be marked as "To Do," "In Progress," or "Done," and this helps users keep track of their progress and prioritize their work.

Another important feature is the ability to log in with your Google account through Firebase Authentication. This ensures that users' to-do lists are always accessible and secure, and it also provides a convenient way to save their tasks and access them from any device.

The app is built with React Bootstrap, which provides a set of pre-built components that make it easy to create a polished, professional-looking interface. Additionally, Sass is used to streamline the styling process and ensure consistency throughout the app.

Finally, React Context is used to manage state and data throughout the app. This provides a centralized way to manage the current user and their tasks, and ensures that the data is always up-to-date and consistent.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
